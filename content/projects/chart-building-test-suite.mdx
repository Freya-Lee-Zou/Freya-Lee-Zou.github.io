## Full Test-Suite For A Chart Building Application

*March 2022 - June 2023*

A comprehensive testing infrastructure project focused on ensuring the reliability and functionality of a chart building web application through extensive test coverage and automated CI/CD processes.

### Key Achievements

- **Team Collaboration**: Collaborated with a team of 4 students to implement a comprehensive test suite (unit tests, integration, and end-to-end tests) for a web application that allows users to build simple charts (line charts, scatter plots, and bar charts)
- **CI/CD Pipeline Development**: Spearheaded the development of a robust CI/CD pipeline for the application using GitHub Actions, establishing branch protection rules on the main branch to enforce code review and successful tests before merging code changes
- **Industry-Standard Testing**: Utilized industry-standard testing frameworks such as Jest framework and Cypress, the DOM Testing Library, and test doubles to ensure thorough coverage and validate critical workflows within the application
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensured comprehensive test coverage across all application components and user interactions

### Technical Skills
JavaScript (Jest, Cypress, Test Doubles), React.js, CI/CD pipeline, Git & GitHub

### Impact
Delivered a robust testing framework that significantly improved application reliability and established best practices for automated testing and continuous integration in web development projects.
